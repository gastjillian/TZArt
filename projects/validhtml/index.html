<p>About Me:</p>
<p>My interest in Digital Media began in my 7th year of school. I was homeschooled and really had no social life except for the communication between me and my virtual teachers and the students. I soon came across the vast community of online chatting website like Discord and Line. There, people openly discussed the views on anything, like gaming or movies. My great escape was Tumblr, a blog site where you can show others your passion and they can show theirs.  My interest peaked further when I came across  a user named ,YoyotheRiceCorpse. Her blog consisted of her artwork from my favorite themes like Studio Ghibli and Japanese character animation short films. I was so inspired by her that I met her at MegaCon 2016 and she shared with me that it took a lot of effort to build her own company with her merch. The web is the most common way to gain exposure for your work and she recommend I take measures in learning how to become my own designer for my online business. This and the encouragement from my father is what lead me on this path I'm on today. </p>
